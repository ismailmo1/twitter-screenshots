# Tweet screenshots

A local school was building a display that showed a collection of tweets showcasing events and activities happening at the school in the past year - this allowed parents and students who didn't have access to twitter still benefit from the content.

The number of tweets was large enough (200+) that manually screenshotting tweets was pretty painful, this utility script  automated that process so teachers could spend time doing more valuable things.

## Demo

To get the user id for a twitter handle you can use a service like https://tweeterid.com/ or just search for 'twitter handle to user id'
